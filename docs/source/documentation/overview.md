# Overview

The LUCI (Land Utilisation and Capability Indicator) model, is a second-generation extension and software im-
plementation of the Polyscape framework, as described in (Jackson et al., 2013). LUCI explores the capability
of a landscape to provide a variety of ecosystem services, such as agricultural production, erosion control, carbon
sequestration, food mitigation, habitat provision etc. It compares the services provided by the current utilisation
of the landscape to estimates of its potential capability, and uses this information to identify areas where change
might be benefcial, and where maintenance of the status quo might be desirable.

## The ecosystem services that LUCI models include:
- Agricultural production
- Erosion risk and sediment delivery
- Carbon sequestration
- Flood mitigation
- Habitat provision
- Water quality â€“ Nitrogen and Phosphorus
